- **Function Code:**
```solidity
/// @dev Get the pool's balance of token1
/// @dev This function is gas optimized to avoid a redundant extcodesize check in addition to the returndatasize check
function balance1() private view returns (uint256) {
    (bool success, bytes memory data) =
        token1.staticcall(abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20Minimal.balanceOf.selector, address(this)));
    require(success && data.length >= 32);
    return abi.decode(data, (uint256));
}
```

- **Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method:** `abi.encodeWithSelector`, `staticcall`, `abi.decode`

## Explanation

- **Purpose:** The `balance1` function retrieves the balance of token1 held by the Uniswap V3 pool. This function is designed to be gas-efficient by avoiding redundant checks.

- **Detailed Usage:** 
- **`abi.encodeWithSelector`**: This method is used to encode the function selector for the `balanceOf` function of the `IERC20Minimal` interface, along with the pool's address. This prepares the data needed for the call to the `balanceOf` function of the ERC20 token contract.
  
- **`staticcall`**: This low-level call is used to execute the `balanceOf` function on the `token1` contract in a read-only manner. `staticcall` ensures that no state changes occur during the execution, making it suitable for view functions like balance checks.

- **`abi.decode`**: This method decodes the returned data from the `staticcall`, extracting the `uint256` balance from the returned bytes.

- **Impact:** The `balance1` function is essential for retrieving the token balance in a gas-efficient manner. By using `staticcall` and `abi.encodeWithSelector`, the function minimizes gas usage and avoids unnecessary checks. This contributes to the overall efficiency and performance of the Uniswap V3 protocol, ensuring that balance queries are quick and cost-effective.

## Conclusion

The `balance1` function in the Uniswap V3 protocol effectively uses `abi.encodeWithSelector`, `staticcall`, and `abi.decode` to retrieve the pool's balance of `token1`. This function demonstrates efficient usage of low-level calls and encoding/decoding mechanisms to optimize gas usage and ensure accurate balance retrieval.
